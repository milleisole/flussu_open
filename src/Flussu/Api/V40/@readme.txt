Classes named 
    `conn`, 
    `engine`, 
    `flow`, 
    `sess`, 
    and `stat` 
are responsible for handling external HTTP requests and interacting with an instance of the "flussuserver" class.

`conn` class is responsible for establishing and managing the connection between the server and the client 
    making the HTTP request. It handles the low-level communication details such as establishing the connection, 
    sending and receiving data.

`engine` class is responsible for processing the incoming HTTP request and determining the appropriate actions to take
    based on the request. It may handle routing, parsing request parameters, and making decisions on how to handle the
    equest.

`flow` class is responsible for controlling the flow of the request processing. 
    It may coordinate the execution of different steps or stages involved in handling the request. It could handle tasks 
    such as authentication, authorization, and executing the necessary business logic.

`sess` class is responsible for managing sessions. 
    It could handle tasks such as session creation, storage, and retrieval. It ensures that user-specific data is maintained
    across multiple requests.

`stat` class is responsible for extracting statistics data. 
    It might track metrics such as request count, response time, or any other relevant data for monitoring and performance 
    analysis purposes.

Each of these classes likely collaborates with the "src/Flussu/Flussuserver" classes to handle the request, perform the necessary 
work, and generate a response back to the client.
