            several on line SAAS applications like flul√π (https://flu.lu) a link shortener and QR code generator and he is an amazon author (https://www.amazon.it/stores/Aldo-Prinzi/author/B0F9VT4XL2).
            Aldo is the CEO of MediGenium SRL a startup who build Meris, a medical appliance, the first solution specifically designed to collect, structure, and secure diagnostic data from clinics and medical centers, thus contributing to the advancement of predictive medicine https://www.medigenium.com
            --- MERIS 
                An innovative system for managing and achiving patient exams and medical documents: patent Pending
                THE LIMIT:An incomplete AI cannot provide effective care. AI in medicine requires vast amounts of data to offer accurate diagnoses, and today, 80% of the data used comes from large hospitals. However, 20% of diagnoses come from medical practices, clinics, and medical centers, and this data is not utilized.
                THE SOLUTION:MeRis is a hardware + software system that connects directly to diagnostic tools already present in clinics, automatically acquiring exams, storing them, anonymizing them, and transforming them into datasets available for scientific research.
                THE IMPACT:
                    - Democratizing access to medical innovation and contributing to the development of AI in healthcare.
                    - Greater access to care
                    - Reduction in printed paper and CDs
                    - Availability of diverse and representative clinical data
                    - Lower costs, greater efficiency, and interoperability
                A solution designed for those currently excluded from digitization:
                    - Specialist and general medical clinics
                    - Medical centers and group practices
                    - Private or affiliated clinics
                    - Thanks to its lease model and intuitive interface, MeRis is ideal even for facilities with limited digital experience.
                June 2023: Production of POC tests and foundation of the startup
                September 2023: Medigenium wins Invitalia's BRAVO INNOVATION HUB
                December 2023: Patent Registration
                June 2024: The European Patent Office recognizes the innovation

                    Raffaele's LinkedIn Profile:https://www.linkedin.com/in/rregni/

                    I began my professional journey in Cyber Security several years ago, from 2000 to 202 at Computer Sciences Corporation. 
                    Their methodologies helped me transform a personal passion into a thriving career. I feel fortunate to approach this work with enthusiasm and dedication, almost as a mission that drives me to continuously study and stay updated every day.
                    As my father says, 'They pay you to do what you would have paid for.' Today, businesses must understand and integrate Cyber Security into their governance and risk management models, addressing both Data Protection and infrastructure resilience. 
                    My extensive experience, both in Italy and abroad, allows me to help companies navigate the daily challenges of cyber threats, designing secure technological infrastructures and optimizing security processes.
                    Currently, I hold dual roles at ACM Cert, an esteemed certification body. 
                    As Head of the Cyber Security Division, I lead the certification process, ensuring that companies meet international security standards, while also conducting audits and providing compliance support. In my capacity as Business Developer for IT Services and Products, I drive growth by identifying market opportunities and fostering client relationships to promote cutting-edge certification solutions.
                    In these roles, my goal is to empower organizations to enhance their security posture and meet the evolving demands of regulatory compliance, while also supporting their broader business objectives. 
                    I believe the skills I bring to the table are worthy of thoughtful consideration.

                    Il vecchio decreto Bersani auspicava l'introduzione in Italia di strumenti aggregativi d'impresa che permettessero alle aziende italiane, praticamente tutte MPMI, di competere in un mercato complesso e globalizzato. 
                    Il nuovo contratto di rete, pur innovando, ha alcune limitazioni soprattutto se misurato nel medio-lungo periodo. 
                    La presentazione introduce un modello innovativo di aggregazione funzionale d'impresa che supera le limitazioni delle aggregazioni temporanee e del contratto di rete
